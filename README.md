# expense_tracker

First Python Project! This is an CLI-based Expense tracker with a wide range of functions:

> work with credit, debit cards or cash;
> record past, present or future purchases;
> track the outstanding balance of your credit card;
> all accounts and purchases are being saved to a .json file

I'm always striving to grow through constructive criticism and suggestions, so please leave your feedback!
